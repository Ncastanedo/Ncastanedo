Civil Engineer, Transports and Logistics specialization. International expertise and multidisciplinary leadership skills, proactivity and excellence in work.

🔥 Unleashing the Power of Technology & Trends 🔍

Led by passion for new technologies, I was pioneer for the application of Blockchain Technology in Ports and Logistics, with wide recognition received that allowed me to be part of the most ambitious projects revolving around Blockchain and Logistics, such as SIMPLE, EBSI or SORTLOT.
